      "answer": "React hooks must be called unconditionally because they rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component. This ensures that hooks are always called in the same order, allowing React to manage state effectively. If hooks were called conditionally, it could lead to unpredictable behavior and state management issues. \n\nSource: [how-does-react-know-which-state-to-return.md]",
